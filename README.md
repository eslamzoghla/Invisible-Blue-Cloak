# Invisible-Blue-Cloak
This project demonstrates a fun and engaging computer vision application that uses OpenCV to make objects or areas of a specific color (blue in this case) "invisible" by replacing them with a captured background. The program creates a magical effect similar to an invisibility cloak, inspired by the concept of chroma keying used in video production.
